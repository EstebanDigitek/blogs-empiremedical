                                        <li>
                                            The forehead. Forehead Botox injections are indicated for the treatment of forehead lines (typically 5 to 25 units) and chronic migraine (typically 20 to 30 units). <br><br>

                        <h4 class="text-purple mb-0">Where Not to Inject Botox  </h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Botox injectors must observe certain broad injection guidelines regardless of patient or procedure. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid injecting Botox into or near major blood vessels, which may increase the risk of systemic complications
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid injecting Botox beneath target muscles, which may also increase systemic complication risk
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid injecting Botox into nonmuscular tissue near active injection sites, such as the vitreous body
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid injecting Botox into the dermis (upper skin layer) or bunched skin, which may reduce the medication’s efficacy
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-left">
                            Clinicians must understand injection procedures for each type of Botox treatment, as the injection process (including site preparation, injection depth, and dosing) varies. As an example, clinicians injecting Botox into a patient’s lower eyelid must tauten the lower eyelid (using the non-dominant hand to pull back the skin and create a smooth injection field). <br><br>

                            Each Botox injection site carries its own set of specific considerations and risks. While it seems easy enough to avoid obvious “no-go” zones like the lips or vitreous body, subtler risks abound. For example, clinicians injecting Botox into the lower forehead or crow’s feet must avoid injecting too close to the upper orbital bone, where a slight needle misplacement can cause ptosis (eyelid droop), an unsightly complication.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-purple mb-0">How to Find the Ideal Location for Each Botox Injection</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            For any given Botox treatment procedure, the ideal location for each injection depends on the condition being treated, the patient’s desired outcomes, and the physiological characteristics of the patient themselves, among other factors. Sample diagrams showing possible injection site locations should not be considered determinative. Clinicians must thoroughly evaluate each individual patient before mapping out where to inject Botox. <br><br>

                            Pre-treatment injection site mapping should occur only after a determination has been made that the patient is a good candidate for Botox treatment (see below). During pre-treatment evaluation for facial injections, clinicians should refer to a facial anatomy guide as they ask patients to make facial expressions — to smile, frown, clench, raise the eyebrows, and execute other facial movements. Clinicians may manipulate the patient’s skin with gloved hands as necessary as well. Once located, clinicians typically mark injection sites with red or black ink.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-purple mb-0">Determining Whether Candidates Should Proceed With Botox Treatment</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Not all prospective patients are suitable candidates for Botox treatment. Mist patients should be excluded from further consideration if they present with any of the following issues:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    An “at risk” condition, such as myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, that requires ongoing medical monitoring 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Diabetes (Type 1 or 2), rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart failure, and certain other serious, chronic underlying health conditions
                                </li>
                                <li>

                            Patients taking certain medications, including blood thinners and muscle relaxers, are generally not suitable candidates for Botox treatment either. Problematic medications include but are not limited to: 
                            
                            <ul>

                                    Clinicians should be cautious when administering Botox treatment to older patients as well. There is no firm age threshold above which treatment is not recommended, but providers should be clear-eyed about the risks and carefully balance elderly patients’ desired outcomes against both the known risks of the treatment in the general population and the higher likelihood of actual medical contraindications in older individuals.

                            No matter where Botox is injected, side effects and complications may occur. The numeric incidence of any Botox side effects is quite low and the likelihood of serious complications is lower still, but it is still important for providers to understand these risks and present them to treatment candidates early on. <br><br>

                            For Botox treatments administered to the face and forehead, the most common visible side effects are crooked or lopsided smile and eyelid drooping. Other possible side effects include but are not limited to:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Swelling or pain at and around the injection site
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bruising or redness at and around the injection site
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Headache
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Flulike symptoms
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Rarely, the active ingredient in Botox (botulinum toxin A) can spread beyond the injection site and cause serious complications in other parts of the body. Signs of such complications include: <br> <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Generalized muscle weakness
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Loss of bladder control
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Trouble speaking or swallowing
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Changes in vision or vision problems
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Following injection, providers must monitor patients to rule out short-term complications that may require immediate medical attention and instruct patients to follow up if any concerns arise in the hours and days after treatment. Most side effects become apparent within hours, but providers should caution patients against strenuous physical activity for at least 24 hours after injection.
