                            Botox injections for bruxism and TMJ dysfunction occur along the jawline and/or around the masseter muscle, the large muscle on the lower sides of the face that controls jaw function. <br><br> Botox injections for chronic migraine
                            occur in a variety of locations around the head, neck, and shoulders, depending on the location of the pain and other patient-specific factors. Some Botox migraine injections, such as those to the back of the head, do not involve
                            the face or neck.

                            The seeds of any successful Botox treatment are sown long before the day of treatment. Providers must carefully evaluate the patient, listen to their concerns carefully, set reasonable expectations about the likely results, and execute the treatment itself
                            with confidence and competence.

                                    Know the Botox face chart like the back of your hand: Every competent Botox practitioner memorizes the Botox face chart. Knowing the general locations where Botox may be injected safely and the prescribed dose ranges for each is a prerequisite for successful
                                    Botox administration. Of course, injecting Botox is a far more exact science than the chart displayed here suggests. Aspiring Botox practitioners must complete a comprehensive,

                                    Carefully evaluate patients for contraindications: Some patients are not good candidates for Botox. These include patients taking medication that may interact with Botox, patients with pronounced facial asymmetry, patients with certain known underlying
                                    health conditions, and aged patients likely to have unknown contraindications. <br><br>

                                    Avoid injections too close to the eyes: One of the most common complications of Botox injection is ptosis, or eyelid droop. Take care to avoid injecting Botox too close to the eyelid or orbital bones, where the medication may spread and affect eyelid
                                    function. <br><br>

                                    Always use a local anesthetic when indicated: Botox injections can be performed without general anesthesia, but fully conscious patients are more likely to experience pain during the procedure and more likely to report negative experiences as a result.
                                    Generously administer local anesthetic (when indicated) and allow enough time for it to take effect. <br><br>

                                    Always put the patient first: Always listen to the patient’s concerns and be prepared to adjust the treatment plan accordingly as long as doing so does not jeopardize patient safety.
