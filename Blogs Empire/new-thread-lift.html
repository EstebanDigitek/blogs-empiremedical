                            Often it is the reflection starring back at your patient that motivates her to make that first call to your office to learn how your expertise can change her reflection temporarily or permanently. <br><br>

                            A saggy face is a reflection that can be corrected with a technique that made a big splash in the 1990s though the mid 2000s, took a hiatus as a well-hyped procedure, and now has come back in a big way – the thread lift or the lunchtime lift – a minimally invasive procedure that can be done in an hour with newfound popularity as a facelift alternative.

                        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">

                                    Originally touted as a quick, relatively inexpensive facelift alternative, some of the initially documented side effects have resolved thanks to new technological advances to tighten up loose, crepey skin of the jowls, neck and/or chin. This minimally invasive procedure uses threads, which have some cones or graspers on them that are passed under the skin using a large needle. These cones literally grab hold of the skin under the skin’s surface, and they pull to re-suspend the skin in a lifted, more youthful position. <br><br>

                                    The result: patients achieve firmer, tighter, smoother, rejuvenated skin without the worry or long recovery time of traditional neck and facelift surgery! Patient’s average cost per procedure is $300-$2,000 based on treatment area and complexity. <br> <br>
