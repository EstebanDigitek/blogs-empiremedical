                            2.6 million dermal filler procedures in 2018, up 2% from the previous year. Among minimally invasive cosmetic procedures, only treatment with medications derived from botulinum toxin type A (such as Botox®) was more popular.

                            them accessible to a broad audience, and their minimally invasive nature, which enables treatment during the course of a handful of short office visits with local anesthetic only. <br><br> Dermal fillers have other advantages

                            months to two years. Hyaluronic acid (HA) filler, by far the most popular type, is easily reversible in most cases. By contrast, certain other face and body augmentation procedures may require surgical intervention to reverse

                        <p class="text-left">Dermal fillers, or soft tissue fillers, are injectable treatments indicated for the mitigation or correction of a variety of age- and non-age-related cosmetic complaints. They reduce the appearance of cosmetic defects such as wrinkles,
                            lines, scars, divots, and hollow areas by increasing skin volume. <br><br> Depending on their type and formulation, dermal fillers may act by temporarily hydrating the treated area, adding or stimulating the production of collagen,
                            or leaving stable microstructures that add volume under the skin. They are most often used on the face but can be applied elsewhere on the body as well.

                        <p class="text-left">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates pharmaceutical products and medical devices in the United States, has approved a range of uses (indications) for dermal fillers. The most common indications include the
                            treatment (reduction) of these common facial complaints:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Nasolabial folds, also known as smile lines (lines between the nose and corners of the mouth).

                                <li>
                                    Marionette lines (lines at the sides of the mouth).

                                <li>
                                    Chin lines.

                                <li>
                                    Loss of cheek volume (sunken or hollow cheeks).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Thin or asymmetric lips

                                <li>
                                    Acne scars and certain other types of facial scars.

                            Injectable fillers may also be used to treat volume loss, wrinkles, and other cosmetic or age-related conditions of the hands.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Dermal Filler Types</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Several different types of dermal fillers are approved for use by the FDA. Each has a discrete set of indications and none is indicated for the treatment of all the conditions described above.
                            <br><br> In addition to its FDA-approved indications, each filler type has its own set of characteristics, including the nature and duration of results produced, that may make it more or less suitable for any given patient.
                            Filler treatment candidates should consult with their providers prior to treatment to determine the appropriate filler and formulation for their needs.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-left">
                            Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Hyaluronic acid filler is the most widely used temporary dermal filler in North America. Due to its efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate facial lines and wrinkles, it’s often referred to as a “wrinkle filler.” Its active
                            ingredient is produced naturally by the body and dissipates relatively quickly, leaving skin temporarily plumper and better-hydrated. HA fillers’ effects last between 6 and 18 months, depending on the condition being treated,
                            the treatment dose, and other factors specific to the patient. Lower-dose touch-ups may prolong results.<a class="text-purple" href="https://www.empiremedicaltraining.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid-injections-face/"> Hyaluronic acid injection</a>                            is also the most easily reversible of all filler treatment types; clinicians may inject an HA-dissolving enzyme (hyaluronidase) to turn back the visible effects of HA treatment.
                        </p>

                        <img src="img-about-fillers/Vector-Smart-Object-1.webp" class="mb-4" alt="vector smart object">

                            Calcium Hydroxylapatite (CaHa). Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHa) stimulates collagen production around the injection site to lessen the appearance of deeper lines, wrinkles, scars, and hollow areas. Like HA, CaHa occurs naturally in the body (mainly in
                            the bones) and does not leave permanent traces of its activity in patients. Its collagen-stimulating effects tend to last longer than HA’s hydrating effects — 12 to 24 months, depending on the patient, condition, and dosing.
                        </p>

                        <img src="img-about-fillers/Vector-Smart-Object-2.webp" class="mb-4" alt="vector smart object">

                            Poly L Lactic Acid. Poly-l-lactic acid also stimulates the production of collagen around the injection site. Unlike CaHa, it’s not naturally found in the body — poly-l-lactic acid is a widely used “biocompatible” synthetic that’s also found in dissolvable
                            stitches. As a biocompatible, it rarely causes significant skin or tissue reactions in patients and is not considered a significant allergy risk (though allergic reactions have occurred after poly-l-lactic acid treatments).
                            Because it produces a robust response, it’s favored for the treatment of deep wrinkles and scars, and its effects last longer than HA or CaHa fillers — two years or longer.
                        </p>

                            Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). PMMA is another synthetic biocompatible that produces the longest-lasting effects of the four filler types described here. Indeed, because the “microspheres” containing PMMA are highly stable and do not dissipate after injection,
                            PMMA filler is considered permanent. <a class="text-purple" href="https://bellafill.com/">Bellafill®</a>, the sole PMMA filler approved for use in the United States, also contains bovine collagen,
                            which helps convey a more natural appearance of increased volume. <br><br> Although this is not an exhaustive list of dermal filler types available globally, it does cover the four main products commonly considered “dermal
                            fillers” and approved for use in the United States by the FDA. <br><br> Certain other non-injectable medical products may be discussed in the same conversation as injectable dermal fillers, including the Permalip lip implant.
                            Likewise, certain other minimally invasive facial augmentation treatments are (or were, in the case of collagen injections) considered as alternatives or complements to injectable dermal filler treatments.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Collagen Injections vs. Dermal Fillers</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Other types of volume-enhancing injection procedures, such as collagen injections, are not widely used by board-certified clinicians in North America. Bellafill is the only FDA-approved filler product that actually contains collagen.<br><br>                            While patients and even some clinicians may casually describe filler brands such as Radiesse® as “collagen fillers,” this is not technically true. Radiesse merely stimulates the body’s natural collagen production rather than
                            add foreign collagen. Due in part to allergy concerns and in part to the arrival of other types of wrinkle fillers on the market, once-popular collagen injections like Zyplast and Zyderm are no longer available in the United
                            States.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Botox vs. Dermal Fillers</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, injectable cosmetic treatments derived from botulinum toxin — principally Botox — are the most popular type of minimally invasive cosmetic injectable on the U.S. market. Board-certified clinicians
                            completed more than 7 million botulinum toxin procedures in 2018, more than twice total number of dermal filler procedures.<br><br> Aside from the obvious pharmacological differences between these
                            two treatment types, Botox and dermal fillers vary in both the mechanism and duration of the results they produce. Specifically, Botox results generally do not last as long between treatments — as little as three to six months,
                            depending on dosing, treatment area, and other factors. HA fillers, the shortest-acting type of dermal filler, typically generate results for at least six months from treatment. <br> <br> Botox and dermal fillers also work
                            differently. Whereas dermal fillers temporarily hydrate the treated area (HA fillers), stimulate collagen production (CaHa and poly-l-lactic acid), or use biocompatible microstructures to add volume (poly-l-lactic acid and
                            PMMA), Botox works by temporarily paralyzing facial muscles around the injection site, smoothing the skin as a result. Botox often produces more noticeable results for conditions involving finer lines, such as crow’s feet.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Autologous Filler Treatments vs. Pharmaceutical Dermal Fillers</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Autologous facial fillers straddle the line between facial fillers and implants. However they are defined, autologous fillers use the patient’s own fat or skin — usually taken from the thigh or abdomen — to increase volume and/or smooth lines and wrinkles
                            at the treatment site. Fat and skin fillers are applied via a grafting procedure that, while somewhat more invasive than injectable filler treatments, can generally be completed in an outpatient setting using local anesthetic
                            only.
                            <br><br> Due to the low risk of local or systemic reaction, the natural appearance of both fat and skin, and their effective permanence, clinicians and patients may prefer autologous fillers to pharmaceutical options.

                            Dermal filler treatments produce visible results within days to a few weeks of treatment, although the actual time to see desired results can vary considerably by filler type, condition, and patient expectations. <br><br> On
                            the question of <a class="text-purple" href="https://www.empiremedicaltraining.com/blog/how-long-does-filler-last/">how long dermal fillers last:</a> Dermal filler results generally last for a minimum of six months. Fillers
                            other than hyaluronic acid produce results for longer periods of time: 12 to 24 months for CaHa fillers, two years or longer for poly-l-lactic acid fillers, and indefinitely for <a class="text-purple" href="#">permanent facial fillers</a>                            like PMMA and autologous implants. <br><br> Many dermal filler treatments require multiple in-office procedures to produce the expected results. These visits typically occur over a period of a few weeks to a few months and
                            may be followed by later “touch-up” visits during which lower doses of filler are administered to maintain or sharpen results. To ensure the results and process remain in line with their expectations, clinicians should thoroughly
                            apprise patients of the likelihood of multiple injection visits and touch-ups. <br><br> Even if follow-up or touch-up injections are not required by the patient’s treatment plan, clinicians should follow up with patients periodically
                            to ensure they are satisfied with the results and identify possible side effects or complications (described in greater detail below). <br><br> Patients dissatisfied with the results of HA filler treatment or experiencing complications
                            from HA filler treatment have reliable recourse: hyaluronidase injection, which can reverse the effects of hyaluronic acid. Reversing the effects of dermal fillers that stimulate collagen production or leave microspheres under
                            the skin is not as straightforward. It is the clinician’s responsibility to communicate the potential risks and drawbacks of non-HA fillers and ensure that the patient fully understands these procedures’ implications.

                            Certain dermal filler side effects and complications are associated with specific filler types. For example, skin granules are more likely to appear after PMMA treatment. <br><br> Additionally, certain serious filler complications
                            are associated with improper injection process or technique. For example, inadequate pretreatment cleaning and sterilization may increase the risk of post-treatment infection. Adverse blood clotting events and vision changes
                            are much more likely to occur when fillers are injected into a blood vessel, which the FDA and filler manufacturers specifically advise against.
