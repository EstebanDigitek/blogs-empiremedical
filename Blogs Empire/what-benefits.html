                        Adrenal glands are responsible for the production of the primary hormones cortisol and DHEA.  DHEA levels during the day drop around 50% of early levels and cortisol levels drop around 90% by the end of the day.  In a healthy individual, DHEA helps to supply energy, enhances libido, functioning of our thyroid gland, and works to improve muscle tone and immune functions.  Cortisol works within the body to adapt to stress and regulating a certain heart and blood pressure in relation to stress.  However, as we age or experience chronic stress both cortisol levels and DHEA output from our adrenal gland may cause an over/underproduction of both. <br><br>

                            Many physicians attending our <span class="text-link">Anti-Aging Module I & II</span> course of Empire Medical realize it is important to continue learning about various topics discussed at the program such as testosterone treatment therapies in older men. Therefore, as a service to all prior attendees, we try to expand on certain topics discussed where there may be more information available. <br><br>

                            Modern integrated medicine has progressed to a point where it can be reasonably stated that normalization of serum testosterone in men who are testosterone-deficient is likely to improve symptoms of fatigue, sexual dysfunction, weakness, or reduced muscle mass, and anecdotal evidence supports testosterone improving mood, sense of well-being, motivation, and osteoporosis. Although testosterone replacement does not work for all individuals it works for the majority of patients and therefore needs to be seen as a viable treatment option or medication not with the disdain of clinicians who are ignorant to be familiar with the benefits associated with testosterone replacement therapies. Just as menopause affects all women, andropause is real and affects all men at different ages.

                            Testosterone therapy may have a wide range of benefits for men, not only in the improvement of sexual symptoms but for a wide variety of metabolic and medical symptoms that promote overall health. The loss of fat and the gain in muscle routinely seen with testosterone therapy represents a positive change in body composition that has implications for cardiovascular and metabolic health. There are substantial observational and interventional studies that strongly indicate important links between testosterone and diabetes as well as testosterone and cardiovascular health. The instance of low testosterone levels is associated with 40-55% in active men with diabetes and has been shown to have reduced insulin resistance. <br><br>

                            In addition, there are changing attitudes regarding testosterone therapy and prostate cancer. Originally, it was feared that testosterone therapy might convert occult prostate cancer into clinical disease, new evidence supports that serum testosterone appears unrelated to prostate cancer risk.

                                    The goal of any treatment is to restore serum testosterone levels to normal (600-800 ng/dL) through lower levels may be adequate for symptom improvement in many men. Treatment options include topical gels, patches, injections, implantable pellets, and a buccal tablet. Gels and patches require daily application, injections are given intramuscular every 1-3 weeks, and pellets may provide adequate serum testosterone concentrations for a range of 3-5 months. Serum testosterone monitoring is mandatory for any of the transdermal modalities since absorption is not uniform and dosage may need to be adjusted to reach therapeutic levels.

                            It is time that the medical community re-evaluates the health benefits of testosterone therapy. Just the word “testosterone” denotes negative connotations (i.e. athletes, bodybuilders, virility) with many physicians when testosterone can be a solution for a variety of health problems for which evidence is lacking. Although there is still much to be learned, it is no longer acceptable to suggest that the benefits are uncertain or that these relate only to sexual function. Testosterone deficiency is a meaningful risk factor for serious medical conditions such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular mortality. <br><br>
