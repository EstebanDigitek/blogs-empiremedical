                            <p class="font-13">Edward Kuhn started his insurance career in finance for Markel Corporation in 1990. Later becoming a licensed agent and forming Liability Insurance Solutions, Inc. in 2001 as a specialty insurance agency. In 2014, Liability
                                Insurance Solutions merged with RXNB Inc to create Wellness Medical Protection Group (WMPG).</p>
                            <p class="font-13">Often medical practitioners dive into alternative therapies and treatments with perhaps little knowledge of what their liability is and what their current insurance policy is covering. Questions arise like: Are you operating
                                under proper HIPAAâ€™s compliant protocols? What is your liability now that you may be performing a procedure that is not FDA approved, but certainly supported by strong training and protocols? Am I paying too much? The insurance
                                market is changing to cover the new cutting edge therapies like stem cells, PRP and even longer practice services like bio-identical hormone therapy and lasers. You may not be covered. Protect your freedom to practice and
                                obtain a checklist that will allow you to measure your current value between price and coverage. The webinar is moderated by Ed Kuhn of Wellness Medical Protection Group, who has covered alternative therapy practices since
                                2001, and saw the development as the new therapies emerged and hit the market.</p>
                            <p class="font-13">Wellness Medical Protection Group originated in 2001 as an independent insurance agency. Recognizing the unique liability insurance demands of medical professionals, WMPG has dedicated themselves to supporting those seeking
